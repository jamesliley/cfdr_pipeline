This readme is to describe the matrices of simulation results

All simulations except for sim_paradj.txt are generated by

../code/run_simulation.R

and analysed in

../code/simulation_analysis.R

The script run_simulation.R can be called with command arguments,
 and the specific arguments to randomly generate a simulation 
 corresponding to each matrix are shown in 

../code/submit.codes.txt

A script which checks R and package versions are correct and then
 demonstrates a reproduction of a random row of each simulation 
 matrix is given in 
 
../code/reproducibility_check.txt




Each simulation file is a space-separated matrix containing the 
 following columns. Variables are explained in section 5 of the 
 manuscript. The meaning of each column is common across all
 simulation matrices, but text files are NOT stored with column
 names.

Column names can be generated with the following R function:


column_names=function() {
nfold=3
vars=c("hit_p",as.vector(
  outer(as.vector(
    outer(as.vector(
      outer(as.vector(
        outer(0:1,1:4,function(x,y) paste0("_fdr",y,"_adj",x))),
        1:2,function(x,y) paste0(x,"_dist",y))),
      1:7,function(x,y) paste0("hit_cf",y,x))),
    c("",paste0("_fold",1:nfold)),function(x,y) paste0(x,y))))

nsv=c("seed","alpha","nhyp","dist1","dist2","n1p","n1q","n1pq","sp","sq",
paste0("fit_",c("pi0","pi1","pi2","tau1","tau2","sigma1","sigma2","conv")),
       "pi0_null","sigma_null","cor_mode","rho")

nfdp=gsub("hit","fdp",vars)
ntdr=gsub("hit","tdr",vars)

matrix_column_names=c(nsv, nfdp,ntdr)
return(matrix_column_names)
}
 


The interpretation of column names and numbers is given below.

 
[1] seed: random seed used to generate the simulation. 
[2] alpha: FDR control level. Either 0.1 or 0.01
[3] nhyp: number of hypotheses
[4] dist1: TRUE effect size distribution for non-null effects.
  1 corresponds to normal, 2 to t (3df), 3 to Cauchy.
[5] dist2: ASSUMED effect size distribution for modelling 
  Z_Q|HP0 and integrating over L. Always 1 (normal).
[6] n1p: number of variables associated with P
[7] n1q: number of variables associated with Q
[8] n1pq: number of variables associated with P and Q
[9] sp: scale of effect size distribution for variables 
  associated with P
[10] sq: scale of effect size distribution for variables 
  associated with Q
[11-17] fit_{x}: parameters of bivariate Gaussian-mixture 
  model for distribution of P,Q. See supplementary material for 
  interpretation. {x} can be in {pi0,pi1,pi2,
  tau1,tau2,sigma1,sigma2}.
[18] conv: indicator for convergence of mixture-Gaussian 
  model.
[19-20] {x}_null: parameters of bivariate Gaussian fitted to 
  distribution of Q|P>0.5. {x} can be in {pi0,sigma}.
[21] cor_mode: correlation structure of observations. Set to 0
  for uncorrelated, 1 for block correlation, and 2 for 
  equicorrelation
[22] rho: correlation between variables. Ignored if cor_mode=0.
[23-920] {A}_cf{B}_fdr{C}_adj{D}_dist{E}_fold{F}: results 
  from simulations. 
  {A}: either fdp or tdr
  {B}: 1-7: type of cfdr estimator. 1: ordinary ECDF. 2: KDE-based
    CDF estimatino. 3: Parametric CDF estimation. 4: KDE-based PDF
    estimation. 5: Parametric PDF estimation. 6: Oracle (correct) 
    PDF estimation. 7: Oracle (correct) CDF estimation.
  {C}: 1,2,3,3b, or 4: type of FDR control method. 1: Original 
    method (outdated). 2: naive method with no leaving points out.
    3: leave out points by block. 4: leave out one point at once. 
  {D}: 0 or 1: include estimate of Pr(Q<q|HP0) in estimator of
    cFDR. 
  {E}: 1 or 2: distribution of P,Q|HP0 used for integration 
    over L-regions. 1 indicates the true distribution, 2 the
    estimated distribution parametrised by pi0_null,sigma_null,
    dist2.
  {F}: 1,2, or 3: fold, only relevant if C=3. Corresponds to
    within-fold FDP/TDR
  Also contains fdp_p and tdr_p corresponding to FDP and TDR of 
    the Benjamini-Hochberg method applied to p-values.
